I worked with Vietnam National University and National University of Singapore.
They have a lot of primate collection. 
Hanoi University of Science campus was Indochinese University under French colonial time. The architecture is kind of special mixing Eastern and Western styles.

In Hanoi University of Science, I met two undergraduates and the curator of the collection. It was very pleasant to work with them.

They took me to the authentic street food. We talked about my experience studying in US and I am surprised to see how international they are than I expected.

I ate this combo 3 times for lunch. I appreciate how they use herbs to balance the tastes so it's refreshing to eat in summer.

I stayed one week in Hanoi to collect samples. Then I did a small travel. I took train to Hue and then Danang.
